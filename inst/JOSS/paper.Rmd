## Summary

Assertive programming follows the principles of fail fast and fail visibly [@shore_fail_2004].
It is implemented by issuing an informative error message if function arguments fail to satisfy specific criteria.
This is particularly important in R because it is dynamically-typed language [@hutchison_evaluating_2012].

`checkr` is a dependency-free, pipe-friendly R package of assertive functions to check the properties of common R objects.
In the case of failure, the functions, which are designed to be used in scripts and packages, issue informative error messages.

The most interesting and unique feature of `checkr` is the use of objects to check the values of other objects using an elegant and expressive syntax. 
For example the values in the `height`, `mass` and `hair_color` columns in the `starwars` data frame are checked using the syntax.

```{r, warning=TRUE}
library(checkr)

check_data(dplyr::starwars, values = list(
  height = c(66L, 264L),
  mass = c(20,1358, NA),
  hair_color = c("blond", "brown", "black", NA)), error = FALSE)
```
